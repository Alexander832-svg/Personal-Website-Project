Santa Ana, Sonora, is a Mexican municipality and the town that serves as its seat, located in the northwestern state of Sonora. It is known as the "key to the Great Altar Desert" ("la llave del gran desierto de Altar") and was founded in 1883 when the Sonoran Railroad was built, with roots tracing back to indigenous Pima settlements. 
The area features desert flora and fauna, historical landmarks like the Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe church, and is a point where roads split towards various destinations in the desert and northern Mexico. </p>

            <p class="text-left"> Santa Ana is one of many small settlements in the state of Sonora, a state that forms a significant part of the U.S.-Mexico border region.
                The state of Sonora is characterized by its arid climate and a mix of historical settlements, modern cities, and rural communities.</p>
                <p class="text">This settlement originated when the Pimas (indigenous people in northwest Mexico) settled in the area now called Santa Ana Viejo attracted by the mission established by the Jesuits.
                     The town was well-established by 1751.</p>
                     <p class="text-left">The present town of Santa Ana was founded by Diego A. Moreno in the year 1883, when the Sonoran Railroad was being built in this area of the state.
                         Santa Ana achieved the status of a municipality in 1935. 
                         The movie The Fast and The Furious was filmed throughout the months of June and July, 2008, in Santa Ana as well as Magdalena de Kino, Sonora.</p>
