    <p> This is the place where i am from, 
Santa Ana, Sonora, is a Mexican municipality and the town that serves as its seat, located in the northwestern state of Sonora. It is known as the "key to the Great Altar Desert" ("la llave del gran desierto de Altar") and was founded in 1883 when the Sonoran Railroad was built, with roots tracing back to indigenous Pima settlements. 
The area features desert flora and fauna, historical landmarks like the Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe church, and is a point where roads split towards various destinations in the desert and northern Mexico. </p>
